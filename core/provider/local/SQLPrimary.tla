---- MODULE SQLPrimary ----
\* A World whose block store writes to its SQL backend (sqlPrimaryStores), as
\* the single-writer deferred engine runs it with the SQL publisher
\* (bstore-sql-publish.go). Each commit is admitted under the writer lock:
\* its blocks join the publisher's overlay and queue for insertion, and the
\* engine's published head advances at once, before MariaDB holds a row.
\* Workers insert the queued blocks with INSERT IGNORE, several at a time and
\* in any order. The committer writes the durable head of commit k to s4db
\* (the local publisher) only after commit k's rows landed and commit k-1's
\* head was written, so the durable head advances one commit at a time. A
\* head that fails to commit fails every commit admitted after it, and the
\* engine reinstalls from the durable head; their queued blocks still land.
\* In-process readers read through the overlay; peers and a restarted backend
\* read the durable head through the local bucket, read only, then SQL. The
\* uploader keeps copying the blocks its markers name from the bucket to SQL.
\*
\* Before the switch the head r0 and the block o it references sit in the
\* bucket with upload markers pending. Commit 1 writes the root n1, which
\* references o; commit 2 writes n2, which references n1 and o. A failed
\* insert stays queued and its worker retries it after a back-off. A restart
\* drops the overlay and the commits after the durable head, and may remount
\* with SQL primary off when Rollback holds: commits then write to the
\* bucket, and the account GC cleanup and eviction run again. The GC sweeps
\* bucket blocks its ref graph cannot reach from either head; the graph
\* records the references only of blocks written to the bucket.
\*
\* The World engine (core/sobject/world/engine) serves writers the admitted
\* head mem and readers the durable head rd, which installs each commit once
\* its head is durable and keeps the World before a failed one. A writer
\* forks under the engine's writer lock, runs its body, during which the
\* consumer (Hyperline) takes its own lock, and commits; CommitAdmit releases
\* the writer lock at admission, and the consumer releases its lock after.
\* A failed head is settled under the writer lock, by the receipt's watcher or
\* by the next writer as it forks: the admitted head returns to the durable
\* one and the reinstall hook, which takes the consumer's lock, reports it. A
\* commit whose base follows a failed head fails without settling it.
\* SettleInCommit models the earlier engine, which settled inside the commit
\* and ran the hook on the writer's goroutine.
\*
\* With PageView the engine keeps each commit's World pages in memory
\* (world-pages.go) and its publication carries only the operation's payload
\* and the replay save. A checkpoint or stall base names a World at or after
\* the last written position in a publication after the admitted ones, which
\* carries the World's kept pages; once it is durable the pages leave memory
\* for the store, and a checkpoint above it adopts it as the replay base. Each
\* state update sweeps the kept pages no live World reaches: the base, the
\* positions from it on, the admitted head, the durable head and the Worlds
\* queued for it (QueuedLive). A restart loses the kept pages and the new
\* engine replays the durable head from the base and the stored payloads.
\*
\* Not modeled: peers, the decoded cache, which holds only blocks already read,
\* the chunking of a commit's blocks, whose rows the committer waits for as a
\* whole, a block shared with an earlier commit, which that commit inserts
\* and commits first, the admission bound, which only delays Commit, a
\* naming publication that fails alone rather than after a failed head, the
\* page view after a rollback remount, and a write's hold on the World after
\* it, which keeps that World's pages until the write is released after it
\* is durable: the page sweep keeps the queued Worlds without relying on it.
\* Without the page view the model names no checkpoint: StableCheckpoint.tla
\* in core/sobject/world/engine models that checkpoint and its state write.
\*
\* SQLPrimary.cfg checks the setting deployments run, without the page view.
\* SQLPrimary-pageview.cfg checks the page view through one commit; through
\* two it reaches about a million states, too many for a workstation's check.

EXTENDS Naturals

\* AckDurable: MariaDB has made a row durable when its INSERT returns, as
\* innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1 does.
AckDurable == TRUE
\* Rollback: a restart may turn SQL primary off.
Rollback == FALSE
\* SettleInCommit: a commit settles a failed head itself, running the hook
\* while its writer holds the consumer's lock.
SettleInCommit == FALSE
\* QueuedLive: the page sweep keeps the Worlds queued for the durable head.
QueuedLive == TRUE
\* DurableLive: the page sweep keeps the durable head's World, which its
\* root pin through the view and the sweep's own live roots both do.
DurableLive == TRUE

\* PageView: the engine keeps the World pages in memory under SQL primary,
\* which deployments leave off. MaxCommit: the commits a run admits, 1 or 2.
CONSTANTS PageView, MaxCommit

Root == <<"r0", "n1", "n2">>
RootOf(k) == Root[k + 1]
\* Commit 1 writes the root n1 and the leaf l1; commit 2 writes the root n2,
\* which shares l1 and o, so n1 is World 1's alone.
Written(k) == IF k = 1 THEN {"n1", "l1"} ELSE {"n2"}
Payload(k) == IF k = 1 THEN "p1" ELSE "p2"
Refs == [b \in {"r0", "o", "n1", "n2", "l1", "p1", "p2"} |->

\* Liveness, under the fairness below: once MariaDB stays up, the durable
\* head keeps catching up with the published one, and readers with it,
\* without a restart. Fairness on Drain stands for workers that retry a

\* landed. A failure is settled and the writer finishes: the hook never waits
