---- MODULE DeadlistLedger ----
\* deadlists.go's save generations: up to three records and two saves in flight.
\* Callers found in replay.go: nameWorld -> name; buildHold/save -> resolve,
\* advance, carry, saved; accept -> adopt; confirmSave -> confirm; unsave ->
\* unsave; newReplay/restoreDeadlists -> lost. engine.go publication failure
\* calls lost when a hold's recount did not submit. Admission unwinds through
\* replay.unsave. These paths are represented below; encoding error leaves a
\* record waiting, and the next adoption may orphan it. Adoption of a disconnected chain orphans records. Capacity eviction is
\* excluded: the bound never fills the production limit of 64.
\* A save snapshots names, puts, cursor and recount atomically under the
\* writer lock; carry and saved have no interleaving caller between them.
\* Confirm reports durability through a generation, never submission alone.
\* Publication order is assumed, as the model-check sidecar requires.
\* Contract booleans retain whether any event broke its rule; they are ghost
\* history, not additional Go fields. Correct runs never distinguish their
\* histories by old watermark/counter values that no future action reads.
\* next is normalized to at least 1, as name does in Go. Fast configs check
\* one record and three saves total; two/three-record cases are manual. At
\* most two saves are in flight, including across one restart. Generation
\* IDs are globally unique model ordinals. Go resets its generation at
\* restart; no surviving comparison can distinguish that reset from these
\* fresh IDs because restart clears flight, carried and recountGen. Keeping
\* the ordinal bounds total saves without renewing the budget at restart.
\* Manual configs: DeadlistLedger-two.cfg (2 records, 3 saves) and
\* DeadlistLedger-full.cfg (3 records, 2 saves); the adoption contract needs
\* at least two records. Slow configs stay outside automatic discovery.
