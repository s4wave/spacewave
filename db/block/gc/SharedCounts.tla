---- MODULE SharedCounts ----
\* Shared counts under version reclamation: which writes add a holder to a
\* stored page, and what applying a deadlist record does to a page another
\* holder still names.
\*
\* Pages are content addressed, so a page's children never change: Kids is
\* fixed and a writer that builds a page identical to a stored one finds it.
\* Each lineage holds one root. Commit moves a lineage to a new root: it writes
\* the pages of the new tree that are not stored, finds the stored ones, and
\* queues a record listing the pages of the old tree the new tree does not
\* reach. extra[p] is the page's count record, its holders minus one; zero means
\* no record. Apply takes one listed page of a record, parent before child, as
\* one store transaction.
\*
\* Holder-creating callers, found from source on Spacewave master aa2254798:
\* - Volume puts that find their block stored: modeled, Land's present pages.
\* - Object copy with skipSubtreeExists (db/bucket/lookup/object-copy.go):
\*   modeled, the writer prunes below a found page and puts nothing there.
\* - SetRootRef from a supplied reference (db/world/block/object-state.go and
\*   sdk/world): modeled, a Commit whose new root is stored.
\* - The deadlist writer (the World engine's nameWorld): modeled. Each commit
\*   joins its lineage's interval, and Name composes the interval into the
\*   records it queues, as Compose sets.
\* - unixfs Copy and the World change log's link: left out. Both give a page
\*   two parents inside one tree, which ReplacementStep.Net refuses to list;
\*   across two trees they are the SetRootRef case.
\* - Owner edges outside a put's flush, such as a reader pin of a World root:
\*   modeled as Pin, which adds a count, and Unpin, which queues a release.
\* The watermark is left out: a record applies only once due.
\*
\* In the code, Apply is RefGraph.ResolveDeaths with ChangeHolds
\* (refgraph-deaths.go), run one record at a time by the Volume's collector.
\* The record's split between pages the commit wrote and pages that existed is
\* Deadlist.Existed, which ReplacementStep.Net derives from the put results.
\* The code nets a named interval of commits once, where the model queues one
\* record per commit in the sequence configs. The interval config also
\* composes the complete chain and checks the focused receipt/recount paths
\* in SharedInterval as separate initial states. The two submodels do not
\* interleave; failed receipts mixed with arbitrary joined trees remain open.
\* HELD: the joined branch still lacks complete replay-root hold accounting.
\* Its CountsCover failure is not yet validated as a Go defect.
\*
\* The put is the one place existence is exact, so the Volume counts there a
\* page the put finds stored whose parent in the new tree it did not also find
\* stored. Under PutRule "reported" the put reports which pages it found, and
\* the record treats only the others as written; under the other rules the
\* record carries the log's view, in which every page the commit wrote is
\* created. The pages the new tree shares with the old
\* one are not written: in the code the log marks them counted, and they are
\* stored at the put because the old root pins them until the root moves,
\* which KeptStored checks.
\*
\* With Race, a commit is two steps, as in the code: Take nets the log, then
\* Put writes the batch, and another lineage may store an identical page in
\* between. The race model gives each lineage its own root over one shared
\* fresh page L, so only that leaf races. RaceApply lets records apply while a
\* commit waits for its put, to show the leaks that allows never free a live
\* page.
\*
\* With Pins, a lineage may pin its current root as a reader does. The pin is an
\* owner edge, so it counts at once, and dropping it queues a release record.
\* Resolve takes one release as the dedicated resolver does: it takes one count
\* from the page and stops if the page lives, and otherwise frees it and pushes
\* one release to each child. It runs at any time after the release's commit,
\* but not while a deadlist record is part way through: the Volume's collector
\* runs one at a time, and a record's push-down counts for its unlisted
\* children land only as it applies their parents.
\*
\* The lineage's hold on its old root stays in extra until the record applies:
\* in the code the record's name under deadlist/ holds its From, and the move
\* that releases the old name nets against it because both land in one physical
\* transaction. HoldAtMove FALSE splits them: the move queues a release of the
\* old root and Name adds the record's count later, which frees a page a new
\* tree still names when the release resolves first.
\*
\* With Fails, a commit is Take then Put over the ordinary roots, and its
\* publication may fail instead: the engine reinstalls the World from before
\* it, so the commit leaves no put, no record and no root, and the next commit
\* starts from the reinstalled root. A put drained before the failure is left
\* out; it stores pages no root names, which leaks.
\*
\* Switches, each TRUE or set to its correct value in every config here;
\* flipping one makes the model fail, which shows the rule it guards is load
\* bearing. SharedCounts.cfg checks two lineages; the variants check one
\* lineage exactly with liveness, failed publications, and the put race:
\* - Serial: one record in flight at a time.
\* - PushDown: an alive listed page adds a holder to its unlisted children.
\* - Refined: an unlisted child's change depends on whether its parent in the
\*   new tree was written by this record's commit (an edge the old page hands
\*   over) or already existed (an edge already counted).
\* - PutRule: "reported" adds a count for each page the put finds stored whose
\*   parent the put did not find stored, and the record learns which pages the
\*   put found; "batch-parent" counts the same way but the record treats every
\*   written page as created; "every" adds one for every page the put finds
\*   stored, and "none" adds no count at the put.
\* - Compose: how Name turns an interval of commits into records. "sequence"
\*   queues each commit's record in order, as if each kept its own found set.
\*   "first" and "last" compose one record the way Replacements.Then does,
\*   dropping a page that died and came back from the dead list, and key the
\*   written set by ref: a page is written if its first, or its last, put in
\*   the interval did not find it stored. "revived" keys by last put and adds
\*   to the record's loss each put that counted a page an earlier commit of
\*   the interval killed.
\* - HoldAtMove: a move and the naming of the record that holds its old root
\*   land in one transaction.
