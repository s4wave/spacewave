---- MODULE SharingWalk ----
\* Sliced recount, with two independent World lineages and three pages.
\* Source: refgraph-sharing.go, refgraph-releases.go, kvtx/sharing.go,
\* root-retention.go:addExistedHolds and engine/world-deaths.go:take/pendingNet.
\* Callers: format.go upgrade and format-copy.go call BeginSharing; Volume.open
\* stops/starts it; publicationWriter.apply calls RecountSharing before puts;
\* Volume.walkSharing runs slices; the property test rewalk stops/starts behind
\* the engine. All enter BeginSharing here. Registered block roots and unknown
\* child lists (Doubt) are excluded: they prohibit trusting any completed count.
\* Child lists are immutable; Put adds a new parent, never mutates its contents.
\* Owner removals can leave surplus sightings: equality holds only without a
\* removal. SharedCounts covers push-down and interval netting, Ledger saves.
\*
\* Boundary "none" is current code. "start" forfeits unnamed intervals only
\* at recount submission. "birth" additionally forbids taking a lineage from
\* any root born before counts became complete unless its record was named
\* before recount. This is an assumption about the engine fix, not built Go.
\* Forfeit removes an unobservable lineage without lost(): recount already
\* includes the surviving physical edges. A future interval may establish a
\* new lineage only from a root first stored with complete counts.

\* Each World root has one replay hold (child list key 1 or 2). Both may
\* also acquire a new child-list edge (key 3 or 4) to the shared payload 3.
